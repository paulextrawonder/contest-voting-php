## Contest Voting WebApp

A Laravel hobby project: contest-voting web app.

Contestants images are uploaded and users/fans vote by making a payment. Payment is powered by PayStack.

_No administrative routes currently. Will be added soon_

## Usage

Uhmm, if you are familiar with Laravel, then you are good to go.

For directional steps to reproduce:
- Of course, you gotta get a laravel setup
```bash
laravel new voteapp
```
- Set up your database credentials correctly
- Violla! Serve the app on a plate of soup ðŸ˜‰ 
```bash
php artisan serve
```
